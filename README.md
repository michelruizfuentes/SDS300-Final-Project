# Investigating the Impact of Monetary Rewards on Choice Behavior, Decision Making and Risk Management

What characteristics influence the decision-making process behind our money management, and can a better understanding of these natural and social phenomena improve our finances? In this project, I investigated risk decisions and their implications for financial professionals such as investors, traders, or brokers. I am using the Choices13K dataset, an open data source retrieved from GitHub that is among the largest human decision response on risk-choice problems datasets with at least 13,000 responses. 

In this study, the participants participated in a series of experiments where they faced two options to gamble: a risk-averse or risk-seeking option. Each option had a different set of possible outcomes. For example, if they chose Option A, there was a certain probability of a 100% chance of a $0 return (risk-averse); however, if they chose Option B, there was a lottery outcome with a. 50-50% chance of winning or losing $100 (risk-seeking). My research question studies if and how participants’ responses contrast with the risky-choice problem when there are known probabilities (certainty) versus unknown probabilities (ambiguity and lottery). In my methodology, I perform a t-test, logistic regression, and a correlation matrix to respond to my research question.

I use neuroscience, psychology, and neurobiology to investigate the underlying biological and social mechanisms that impact decision-making and confidence in financial risk management. 
* For the neuroscience research, I investigated how desire activates our neural reward system and dopamine system, which influences the processes for decision-making in the limbic system and neocortex. 
* Then in the psychology discipline, I researched behavioral biases and behavioral finance protocols under the CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst non-profit) to observe how emotions and pleasure-seeking approach vs. loss aversion approach impact decision-making. 
* And lastly, in my research within the neurobiology field, I studied interoceptive abilities and genetics, such as testosterone, and how the levels of each explain the nuances of financial decision-making. 

Research Question:
* How do the participant’s responses to the risky-choice problem contrast with known probabil- ities (certainty) versus unknown probabilities (ambiguity and lottery)?

Hypothesis:
* Null Hypothesis states there is no difference in the mean rate of participants choosing either Option A or Option B depending on whether they receive feedback. The true difference between the group means is equal to zero.
* Alternative Hypothesis states there is a difference in the mean rate of participants choosing either Option A or Option B depending on whether they receive feedback. The true difference between the group means is different from zero.
