# Investigating the Impact of Monetary Rewards on Choice Behavior, Decision Making and Risk Management

In my final project in SDS 300: Topics in SDS Applications in Neuroscience and Psychology, I will focus on understanding risk decisions and the implications for financial professionals such as investors, traders, or brokers. I am using the Choices13K dataset, an open data source retrieved from GitHub that is among the largest human decision response on risk-choice problems datasets with at least 13,000 responses. In this study, the participants participated in a series of experiments where they faced two options to gamble: a risk-averse or risk-seeking option. Each option had a different set of possible outcomes. For example, if they chose Option A, there was a certain probability of a 100% chance of a $0 return (risk-averse); however, if they chose Option B, there was a lottery outcome with a. 50-50% chance of winning or losing $100 (risk-seeking). My research question studies if and how participants' responses contrast with the risky-choice problem when there are known probabilities (certainty) versus unknown probabilities (ambiguity and lottery). 

I use neuroscience, psychology, and neurobiology to investigate the underlying biological and social mechanisms that impact decision-making and confidence in financial risk management. For the neuroscience research, I investigated how desire activates our neural reward system and dopamine system, which influences the processes for decision-making in the limbic system and neocortex. Then in the psychology discipline, I researched behavioral biases and behavioral finance protocols under the CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst non-profit) to observe how emotions and pleasure-seeking approach vs. loss aversion approach impact decision-making. And lastly, in my research within the neurobiology field, I studied interoceptive abilities and genetics, such as testosterone, and how the levels of each explain the nuances of financial decision-making. In my methodology, I perform a t-test, logistic regression, and multiple logistic regression to respond to my research question, and this is still in progress.
